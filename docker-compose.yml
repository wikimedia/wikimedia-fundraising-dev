# Setup for Fundraising development environment

version: '3.7'

# By setting an invalid default for FR_DOCKER_UID and FR_DOCKER_GID, we prevent
# bringing up the application without a user being specified (which can happen
# if setup.sh hasn't been run yet). This prevents the containers from running
# and creating files as root (which causes issues later on).
